# GGJGameProject 

My teams attempt to create a game to play within 48 hours. Feel free to check out the code.

You can find the code in scripts. Where I was responsible for the movement of the character and sprite animation. We used C# and unity for the creation of this game.

# A taste of home

You are a spirit that are visiting people who are starting a new life in a new city and they are home sick and you have the ability to roam through their house. The objective is to look at objects in the person's house to get a better understanding of who they are. Once you have a full understanding of the person, you will make a dish that gives the person a taste of their "home".



# Gameplay rules

Option to create the dish will not be available until the spirit interacts with all the objects related to the dish.

Interacting with each object will add some color to the room. Creating each dish will increase the brightness of the room.

Same point in all three apartment's kitchens to create dishes
